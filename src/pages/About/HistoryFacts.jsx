				The college since inception has existed as two colleges running nursing
				and midwifery programmes under two administrations namely Nurse's
				Training College (NTC) and Midwifery Training School (MTS). In 2007 both
				institutions merged under one administration hence the name Nursing and
				Midwifery Training College (NMTC)
			</p>
			<p>
				The nursing programme was started in 11<sup>th</sup> January, 1995 with
				a State Registered Nursing (SRN) ceritificate program which was three
				years duration. In 1968, a two-year Enrolled Nursing (EN) programme was
				introduced which ran alongside the SRN. The SRN certificate programme
				later gave way to a 3-year comprehensive SRN programme in August 1969.
				In 1983, the Enrolled Nursing program was phased out. A Registered
				General Nursing (RGN) Diploma programme was introduced in 1999 and that
				is what is currently running.
			</p>
			<p>
				The Midwifery programme also started in 1957, with a two year and two
				and a half year duration depending on one's qualification. These
				continued until the early 1980s when it was replaced with a Post Basic
				programme after completion of SRN. A three year Registered Midwifery
				(RM) Diploma programme was introduced in 2003. These programmes run
				concurrently till 2007 when the certificate was phased out. Currently
				the College is runnung a 3-year Diploma in Registered General Nursing
				and Registered Midwifery.
			</p>
			<p>
				The College also runs a 2-year Post Nurse Assistant Clinical/Nurse
				Assistant Preventive (NAC/NAP) certificate in Midwifery programme since
				September, 2016.
